# 【News LIE-brary】From Scrum to Cyrodiil: Rugby Star Daisuke Maeda Reveals Unexpected Training Secret - Oblivion Remastered!

**TOKYO** – In a revelation that has left both sports analysts and gaming communities buzzing, celebrated Japanese rugby winger Daisuke Maeda, known for his blistering pace and relentless work ethic on the field, has divulged an unorthodox component of his off-season training regimen: extensive hours spent playing the highly anticipated, yet-to-be-released "The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered".

Maeda, fresh off a stellar season with his club, Tokyo Sungoliath, and a key figure in the national team setup, made the surprising admission during a recent online fan Q&A session. When asked about his methods for maintaining focus and reaction speed during the off-season, Maeda initially chuckled before offering a response that few anticipated.

"Of course, the physical conditioning, the gym work, the track sessions – they are the foundation, non-negotiable," Maeda explained, speaking through an interpreter. "But mental sharpness, the ability to process information quickly under pressure, to anticipate and react... this is also crucial. And for that," he paused, a grin spreading across his face, "I have found an unlikely ally in Cyrodiil."

Cyrodiil, the fantasy world setting for Bethesda Softworks' iconic role-playing game "The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion," first released in 2006, is perhaps not the first place one would associate with elite athletic training. However, Maeda insisted that the upcoming remastered version, rumoured to feature significantly enhanced graphics, improved AI, and potentially new gameplay mechanics, provides a unique mental workout.

"People might laugh," Maeda continued, "but navigating the complex dungeons, managing inventory, reacting to sudden ambushes from Daedra, even picking locks – it requires intense concentration and quick decision-making. The remastered version, from what I've been fortunate enough to experience [implying access to an early build or beta], is incredibly immersive. The improved visual fidelity and smoother performance demand even greater focus. You cannot switch off for a moment, much like during a crucial phase of play in a rugby match."

Maeda elaborated on the specific parallels he draws between the game and his sport. "Tracking multiple questlines simultaneously is like monitoring opposition players' movements across the pitch. Reacting to a surprise attack from behind a pillar... well, it’s not *exactly* like being tackled, but the need for instantaneous reaction is similar. It keeps the mind agile."

The revelation has sparked considerable discussion online. While some fans lauded Maeda's innovative approach, others expressed scepticism. Sports psychologists contacted by News LIE-brary offered mixed opinions, with some acknowledging the potential cognitive benefits of complex video games, while others stressed that there is no substitute for sport-specific drills and real-world physical conditioning.

Bethesda Softworks, the developers behind the Elder Scrolls series, have yet to officially comment on Maeda's statements or confirm his access to an early version of "Oblivion Remastered." However, the game, whose existence has been the subject of intense fan speculation for years following the success of the Skyrim Anniversary Edition, is rumoured to be nearing an official announcement, possibly targeting a late 2025 or early 2026 release window.

Maeda’s coaching staff, when approached, seemed mildly bemused but supportive. Head coach Kenji Tanaka commented, "Daisuke is an incredibly dedicated athlete. He is always looking for ways to gain an edge. If exploring the world of Oblivion helps him maintain his mental acuity during the downtime, and he continues to meet all his physical targets, who are we to argue? Perhaps we should install consoles in the team lounge."

Whether Maeda's unique training tool translates to continued on-field success remains to be seen. But one thing is certain: his unexpected endorsement has thrust "The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered" into an even brighter spotlight, bridging the gap between the rough-and-tumble world of professional rugby and the sprawling fantasy landscapes of Tamriel in a way nobody could have predicted. Fans will be watching both Maeda's performance next season and any news from Bethesda with heightened interest.
